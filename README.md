With the infrastructure here, you don't need to write your TailwindCss usage in a long way on a single line.

## Getting Started

- Define the variables you want to use in `src/core/style/ResponsiveProps.ts`
- You can change the screen sizes in `tailwind.config.ts`

```
<Button
  className="bg-blue-300 text-white hover:shadow-xl"
  xs="bg-white text-black"
  sm="bg-black text-white"
  md="w-2/4"
  lg="w-3/4"
  xl="h-20"
  xxl="h-10 w-2/5"
>
  Buralar eskiden dutluktu!
</Button>
```

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense settings have been added in `.vscode/settings.json`

Have fun and please don't forget to give stars :)
